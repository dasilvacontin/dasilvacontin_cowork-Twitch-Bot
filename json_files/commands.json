My name is David. 7-9AM UK time I work on my side project \"Road to 25k/month\", whose goal is to reach $25000 revenue per month by releasing a course about how to make online multiplayer games.

I also love boardgames, videogames (how I started coding), longboarding, and making innovative interactive art. See you around!!! <3 <3",
